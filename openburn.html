        <h2>My work on OpenBurn</h2>
        <p>
            At the time, the only other major project I had worked on was <a href=https://sojourner.me/momentum.html>Momentum Mod</a>,
            so I chose to write OpenBurn in C++, utilizing the Qt framework. This could be interpreted as either
            a very wise choice or a very poor one.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Qt framework is exceptional, with best-in-class documentation for almost everything it can do. It is extremely
            powerful and allows for quite easy cross-platform GUI applications that look native. However,
            the choice to write the application in C++ ended up biting me as the application grew in scope.
            It became increasingly difficult to effectively refactor my ad-hoc codebase.
            I remember spending a long time beating my head against a memory leak caused by 
            passing around shared pointers with move constructors, trying to change the ownership of an object.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            A lot of this friction was caused by the fact that the design and architecture of OpenBurn was not very well thought-out.
            I just dove in headfirst without really knowing what I was doing in any way!
            I learned about many common design matterns (like the MVC architecture used by Qt) as I was going, which meant that
            refactoring got harder and harder as I added more features without realizing what a mess I was making.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            However, my suffering paid off, and I released verion 0.1a of OpenBurn in late 2017. The "MVP" release allowed for 
            simulation of the solid-state burn phase of a solid rocket motor with arbitrary propellants. I was proud of the
            graphics I had created to animate the simulated motor "burning", and even added features commonly requested by users
            of BurnSim, such as calculating the mass flux (the amount of mass flow per unit area) at any point in the thrust chamber.

            I began work on adding new features requested by the friends I shared with, such as more grain types. However, at this point,
            the bad architecture began to really catch up with me. It was monumentually difficult to add new grain types as it required
            overloading classes for drawing the grain and simulating the grain. I was also having a hard time finding closed-form simulation
            equations for common propellant grain types such as a fin-o-cyl. At this point I even went as far as reverse engineering BurnSim to
            understand the algorithms Greg had used to simulate complex grain shapes.
