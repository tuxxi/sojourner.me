        <h2>Momentum Mod</h2>
        <p class=lead> <a href=https://momentum-mod.org>momentum-mod.org</a></p>
        <p> Momentum Mod is a free, open-source speedrunning game based on community game-modes 
        for Counter-Strike such as Surf, Bunnyhop, and more. I used to spend hours of my day 
        surfing on community servers and I wanted to give back to the community.</p>
        <p> I worked on Momentum Mod for ~2 years in the "early days" from around 2016 to 2018
        (actually around a year after work initially began on the project). Back then, we had very few
        people working on the game, I was one of only 5 developers, and it was very much a 
        seat-of-the-pants affair. We knew very little and cared even less about what we didn't know.</p>
        <p> Momentum was actually the reason I got into programming to begin with. I knew I wanted
        to contribute, so I took an online C++ intro class and messed around with the enormous codebase
        in my free time.</p>
        <p> As I grew more confident, I worked on more important aspects of the game. For example, I
        implemented the "replay" feature that allows people to watch their run after they finish, and            share it with others. 
        <p> As the project matured and more people became interested, the team grew to be far 
        more organized and effective.
        It was around this time that my interest in surfing and bunnyhopping began to fade, 
        and I began to struggle more with utilizing our 
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFYi1ugN1f8">outdated game engine</a>
        instead of seeing it as a fun resource-constrained challenge as I had in the beginning. 
        So I passed the torch to the growing group of new developers and moved on to other projects. </p>
